# Top down movement demo

In this game we have an object under player control - a knight - and randomly
spawned barrier objects which could be roughly considered water. The knight can
move around the world freely but cannot walk into the water.

This demonstrates a few features:

- Animation
- Player control with keyboard and gamepad/joystick analog movement
- Object collision
